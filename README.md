# Audumbla : Cow-Cow Week

Requirements (part 2: Spring REST API
Following on from the last project, you have been asked to creat a RESTful API that exposes data from the MySQL World Database
The API should allow someone to perform CRUD operation on the 3 tables
You should use good error handling to report on misuse of the API with good messaging and correct status codes
Think carefully about the design of your API and how you will use path variables, request bodies ond request parameters
In addition, you will need to research how to do the following:
Secure the endpoints using an API key. Someone without the key with only be able to read data (Not using Spring Security)
Use Swagger UI to provide a graphical interface to your API
The API should be tested using MockMVC for integration testing and WebMVCTests for unit testing
